# equitable-cycling-networks

The San Francisco network data in `data/V2_SF_course_graph_cluster` and the bikeability computation code in `bikeability_functions.py`, `dem_functions.py` and `yan_helper_functions.py` is from Yan's work in *Equity, Mobility, and Sustainability: Analyzing Geographic and Demographic Disparities in Urban Bikeability*. Their full repository can be found here: https://github.com/KYan19/cycling-equity. 

In `contemp_algs.ipynb`, we implement cycling network growth strategies from the literature and analyze their impact on Yan's equity metrics. 

In `optimization.ipynb`, we implement our novel network optimization approach and similarly analyze its impact on Yan's equity metrics.
